# REACT PORTFOLIO

A professional portfolio is a great way to showcase your own work to future employers or customers. 

## Description

The goal for this project was to create an updated developer portfolio using React. 

My new portfolio was created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 5
* Javascript
* React
* Font Awesome
* Google Fonts
* github pages - for deployment


I first created a simple HTML/Bootstrap/CSS template before creating a React app, then I seperated my template into smaller components to place into their own js component files. 


## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Mock Up

## Future Development & Missing Pieces

In future, I would like to make my navbar links stay highlighted when on their specific section.

I decided to not share my personal details/resume on this.

I still need to make the contact form send messages to me, but the validation is working.
