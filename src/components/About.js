                I spent the last decade travelling around the
                world, settling down in Austin, Texas before moving to Manchester (UK) in late 2019. While stuck in lockdown I
                completed my BA in Criminology where I spent my last semester studying
                cyber crime. I moved back to Australian in 2020 where I decided to pursue coding head on! When I'm not hunched
                over my macbook staring furiously at some code, you'll probably find me at the cinema! 😉
